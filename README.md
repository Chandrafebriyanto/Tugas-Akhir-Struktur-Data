# 🌏 ASEAN Map Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visualization tool that plots a map of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries using basic data structures and file handling concepts. It was developed as part of a final assignment for a Data Structures course.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `aseanmap.py`: The main Python script that loads coordinate data from a text file and visualizes the ASEAN map.
- `koordinat.txt`: Contains longitude and latitude coordinates of major ASEAN countries and cities (make sure this file is in the same directory as the script).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## 📌 Features

- Reads and parses coordinate data from a text file.
- Uses `matplotlib` for plotting country points on a 2D map.
- Displays labeled markers for ASEAN member countries.
- Demonstrates usage of fundamental data structures like lists and dictionaries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
- Basic file I/O in Python
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrafebriyanto/Tugas-Akhir-Struktur-Data.git
   cd Tugas-Akhir-Struktur-Data

2. Make sure you have Python 3 and matplotlib installed:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python aseanmap.py

## 🌐 Output
The script will display a simple plotted map of ASEAN countries based on the provided coordinates. Each country/city is marked with a point and labeled.

##📚 Learning Outcomes
This project reinforces:
  -Parsing structured text files in Python
  -Using Python dictionaries to map labels to data
  -Plotting using matplotlib
  -Applying data structures to solve real-world problems

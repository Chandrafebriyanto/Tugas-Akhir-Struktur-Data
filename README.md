# ASEAN Map Visualization

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the ASEAN member states on a map using the `matplotlib` and `basemap` libraries. The script highlights each country and labels it, providing a simple geographical representation of the ASEAN region.

## Features

- Renders a world map centered around the ASEAN region.
- Highlights and labels each of the 10 ASEAN member states: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia.
- Uses different colors to distinguish land, ocean, and country fills for better visualization.
- Displays country names clearly on the map.

## Requirements

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `basemap` (and its data dependencies)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Chandrafebriyanto/Tugas-Akhir-Struktur-Data.git](https://github.com/Chandrafebriyanto/Tugas-Akhir-Struktur-Data.git)
    cd Tugas-Akhir-Struktur-Data
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    pip install basemap
    pip install basemap-data-hires # For high-resolution coastlines (optional but recommended)
    ```

    **Note on `basemap` installation:** `basemap` can sometimes be tricky to install directly via `pip` due to its dependencies on GEOS and PROJ4. If you encounter issues, consider using `conda` for installation (`conda install -c anaconda basemap`) or refer to the Basemap documentation for specific instructions for your operating system.

## Usage

To run the script and display the ASEAN map:

```bash
python aseanmap.py
```

This will open a `matplotlib` window displaying the generated map.

## Output

The script generates a map similar to the following:

*(Note: An example image `asean_map_example.png` should be placed in an `images` directory within your repository for this to display correctly in the README.)*
